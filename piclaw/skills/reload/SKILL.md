# Reload Piclaw (force)

Reinstall the piclaw package from workspace source and restart the running process
immediately. The new process takes over on the same port.

> ⚠️ **Important (container runtime):**
> Always install to `/usr/local/lib/bun/install/global/node_modules/piclaw`.
> Do **not** deploy to `/home/agent/.bun/...` in this container, or Supervisor may keep running an older build.

## Steps

Run the following as a **single bash invocation**:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
export BUN_INSTALL="/usr/local/lib/bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"

# 1. Build
cd /workspace/piclaw && make build-piclaw

# 2. Pack and install to the active global runtime path (real files, not symlinks)
cd /workspace/piclaw/piclaw
bun pm pack --destination /tmp
TARBALL=$(ls -t /tmp/piclaw-*.tgz | head -1)
DEST="$BUN_INSTALL/install/global/node_modules/piclaw"
sudo rm -rf "$DEST"
sudo mkdir -p "$DEST"
sudo tar -xzf "$TARBALL" -C "$DEST" --strip-components=1
rm -f "$TARBALL"
cd "$DEST" && sudo BUN_INSTALL_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/bun-cache bun install --production || true

# 3. Quick sanity check: show where piclaw resolves from
PICLAW_BIN=$(command -v piclaw || true)
echo "piclaw binary: ${PICLAW_BIN:-not found}"
[ -n "$PICLAW_BIN" ] && readlink -f "$PICLAW_BIN" || true

# 4. Launch restart (self-detaches + waits for current turn to finish)
#    Logs stream to /tmp/restart-piclaw-force.log by default.
PICLAW_RELOAD_LOG=/tmp/restart-piclaw-force.log \
  /workspace/.pi/skills/reload/restart-piclaw.sh

echo "Reload scheduled. Check /tmp/restart-piclaw-force.log for status."
```

## How It Works

The restart script (`restart-piclaw.sh`) auto-detects the service manager and restarts
piclaw through it. Detection order (first match wins):

| Priority | Check | Method |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 0 | `PICLAW_SERVICE_MANAGER` env var set | Use its value directly (`supervisor`, `systemd`, `manual`) |
| 1 | `supervisorctl` binary exists AND a `piclaw` program is registered | `supervisorctl restart piclaw` |
| 2 | `systemctl` binary exists AND a `piclaw.service` user unit exists | `systemctl --user restart piclaw.service` |
| 3 | Neither found | Manual kill + start fallback |

Before restarting, the script:
1. Waits (up to 120s) for the active agent turn to finish by polling `/agent/status`
2. Queues a `resume_pending` IPC task so interrupted turns can resume after restart

### Supervisor path (default in Docker containers)

Uses `supervisorctl -c <config> restart piclaw`. The config path is auto-detected:
- `/workspace/.piclaw/supervisor/supervisord.conf` (preferred)
- `/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf` (fallback)
- Override with `PICLAW_SUPERVISORCTL_CONFIG`

If `supervisorctl` is found but the restart fails, the script **aborts** (exit 1) to avoid
conflicting with Supervisor's own restart logic.

### Systemd --user path (for non-Docker hosts)

Uses `systemctl --user restart piclaw.service`. Override the unit name with
`PICLAW_SYSTEMD_UNIT`.

If the restart fails, the script aborts.

### Manual fallback

Kills the old process (via PID file or `OLD_PID` arg), waits for the port to free up,
and starts `piclaw --port 8080` in a tiny supervisor loop (5 retries). Override the
command with `-- piclaw --port 8080`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PICLAW_SERVICE_MANAGER` | (auto) | Force `supervisor`, `systemd`, or `manual` |
| `PICLAW_SUPERVISOR_SERVICE` | `piclaw` | Supervisor program name |
| `PICLAW_SUPERVISORCTL_BIN` | `supervisorctl` | supervisorctl binary |
| `PICLAW_SUPERVISORCTL_CONFIG` | (auto) | Supervisor config path |
| `PICLAW_SYSTEMD_UNIT` | `piclaw.service` | systemd --user unit name |
| `PICLAW_WEB_PORT` | `8080` | Port to wait for / pass to piclaw |
| `PICLAW_RELOAD_LOG` | `/tmp/restart-piclaw-force.log` | Async log file |
| `PICLAW_RELOAD_ASYNC` | `1` | Set `0` for sync (foreground) mode |

## Important Notes

- Bun and piclaw are installed globally under `/usr/local/lib/bun` (root-owned).
- The script logs the detected service manager and resolved `piclaw` binary path for easier debugging.
- WhatsApp session state persists across restarts (stored in SQLite + auth dir).
- Check `/tmp/restart-piclaw-force.log` if something goes wrong.
