# Enable local PDF export from the draw.io editor

## Summary

The vendored draw.io build currently routes PDF export through `EXPORT_URL`
(an external draw.io server endpoint), which means File → Export as PDF
either silently fails or attempts an external network call.

SVG, PNG, and XML exports already work locally via the `workspace-export`
postMessage interception and `POST /drawio/save`. PDF needs the same
local save path.

## Problem

Draw.io's client-side PDF generation depends on a server-side export
service (`EXPORT_URL`). The self-hosted vendored build has no such
service running, so PDF export is effectively broken.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File → Export as PDF saves the PDF to the workspace, same as SVG/PNG/XML.
- [ ] No external network call to draw.io servers.
- [ ] The export uses client-side PDF generation (e.g. jsPDF or the draw.io
      built-in PDF path if available without EXPORT_URL).
- [ ] The saved PDF is a valid, openable PDF document.
- [ ] If client-side PDF is not feasible, document why and propose an
      alternative (e.g. server-side SVG→PDF conversion).

## Investigation Notes

- Draw.io's built-in PDF export path appears to require the external
  `EXPORT_URL` endpoint for rendering.
- Possible alternatives:
  - Intercept the SVG output and convert to PDF client-side via jsPDF + svg2pdf.js
  - Convert server-side using a headless renderer if one is available in the container
  - Patch the draw.io export dialog to disable the PDF option with a clear message
- The `workspace-export` interception already handles `saveData` and
  `exportFile` — PDF may need a different hook if draw.io routes it
  through a separate code path.

## Implementation Paths Considered (historical)

- Native/local PDF export was investigated but not accepted as part of the current self-hosted draw.io integration.
- The remaining viable paths depend on extra server-side/export-rendering components or a materially broader conversion stack than this ticket intended.
- This ticket is therefore closed as unsupported in the current product scope rather than treated as an unfinished implementation bug.

## Updates

### 2026-03-22
- Lane change: `40-review` → `50-done` by user direction.
- Closed as **unsupported / not-done**.
- Rationale:
  - draw.io's PDF export path depends on server-side export/rendering components (`EXPORT_URL` or equivalent);
  - the current self-hosted/local-only integration does not ship those components;
  - supporting PDF export cleanly would require extra server/export infrastructure or a broader alternative conversion pipeline outside this ticket's intended scope.
- Practical outcome: SVG/PNG/XML remain the supported local export formats for the current draw.io integration.
