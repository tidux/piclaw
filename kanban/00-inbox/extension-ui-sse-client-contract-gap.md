# Audit and resolve extension UI SSE client contract gap

## Summary

The web server still emits a full `extension_ui_*` SSE family from
`piclaw/src/channels/web/ui-bridge.ts`, and server-side tests verify those
emissions.

However, the main web SSE client (`piclaw/web/src/api.ts`) does not currently
register listeners for those events, and the main app shell does not appear to
consume them.

This may be intentional latent groundwork for richer extension UI, but the API/
SSE audit has now surfaced it as an explicit contract gap that should be
resolved deliberately rather than left implicit.

## Why

Right now the contract is ambiguous:

- the server advertises/emits `extension_ui_*`
- the SSE transport treats them as real chat-scoped events
- tests cover their emission on the server side
- the main web client does not currently subscribe to them

That leaves three possibilities:

1. the client integration is missing,
2. the server-side emissions are dormant groundwork and should be documented as
   such, or
3. the contract should be narrowed and some emitted events removed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Confirm whether the current web product surface is supposed to support `extension_ui_*`
- [ ] Inventory all emitted `extension_ui_*` events and intended frontend behavior
- [ ] Either wire the supported events into the main web client, or explicitly de-scope/document them
- [ ] Remove any dead event names if they are not part of the intended product surface
- [ ] Add/adjust tests to match the decided contract

## Relevant Areas

- `piclaw/piclaw/src/channels/web/ui-bridge.ts`
- `piclaw/piclaw/src/channels/web/sse.ts`
- `piclaw/piclaw/web/src/api.ts`
- `piclaw/piclaw/web/src/app.ts`
- `piclaw/piclaw/test/channels/web/ui-context.test.ts`
- `piclaw/piclaw/test/channels/web/web-sse-client.test.ts`
- `piclaw/piclaw/docs/web-sse-inventory.md`

## Updates

### 2026-03-16
- Created from the active API/SSE audit after confirming:
  - server emits `extension_ui_request`, `extension_ui_timeout`, `extension_ui_notify`, `extension_ui_status`, `extension_ui_working`, `extension_ui_widget`, `extension_ui_title`, `extension_ui_editor_text`, and `extension_ui_error`
  - `web/src/api.ts` does not currently register listeners for those names
  - the main app shell does not currently appear to consume them directly
