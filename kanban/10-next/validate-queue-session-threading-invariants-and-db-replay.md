# Validate queue/session/threading invariants and DB replay checks

## Summary

Run the logic-validation and replay-oriented part of the former XL test audit,
focused on queue/session/threading invariants, DB evidence, and branch/session
isolation.

This work should coordinate with the active ticket:

- `kanban/20-doing/audit-session-turn-management-regression-checklist.md`

so effort is complementary rather than duplicated.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Queue/thread invariants are explicitly asserted under retries and queued follow-up flows.
- [ ] Branch/session isolation is validated with targeted DB/API evidence.
- [ ] Recovery and queued follow-up hydration are validated via test and/or replay checks.
- [ ] Any duplicate overlap with the active regression-audit ticket is resolved into a single evidence path.
- [ ] Any failures found are fixed or split into explicit bug tickets.

## Test Plan

- [ ] Extend or run targeted tests:
  - `runtime/test/channels/web/http-dispatch-agent.test.ts`
  - `runtime/test/channels/web/agent-message-handler.test.ts`
  - `runtime/test/channels/web/message-write-flows.test.ts`
  - `runtime/test/channels/web/recovery.test.ts`
- [ ] Capture one DB evidence slice for affected `chat_jid` / branch cases where useful.
- [ ] Reuse the active session-turn-management audit script/checklist where possible.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Queue/session/threading invariant evidence is recorded.
- [ ] Branch isolation/replay checks are recorded.
- [ ] Any discovered regressions are fixed or split.
- [ ] Overlap with the session-turn-management audit is resolved cleanly.

## Updates

### 2026-03-26
- Created by splitting the XL umbrella ticket `test-suite-audit-with-fuzzing-logic-validation` into smaller execution units.
- This ticket owns the logic-validation / DB replay part of the old Pass 4 and some of Pass 5.
- Expected to coordinate closely with `audit-session-turn-management-regression-checklist`.
