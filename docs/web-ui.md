# Web UI

Piclaw ships with a single-user streaming web UI that combines chat, workspace,
editor, terminal, viewers, and lightweight control surfaces in one app.

This page is the compact feature tour that used to live inline in `README.md`.

## Chat and status surfaces

### Streaming chat

- thought and draft panels during streaming
- live steering and queued follow-ups
- Adaptive Cards with persisted submissions
- `/btw` side conversations
- file attachments, link previews, and threaded turns
- syntax-highlighted previews for common text/code attachments
- theme and tint controls via `/theme` and `/tint`

### Tool and turn status

The status surface is designed to keep the most useful in-flight context visible
instead of collapsing everything into generic waiting copy.

Current behavior:

- active `tool_call` / `tool_status` rows stay visible during silence probing
  instead of being replaced immediately by `Waiting for model…`
- recent-activity restore keeps the last meaningful status payload when the web
  UI reconnects or when you return to an active chat
- tool-status rows can show an age hint in the meta row, alongside git/status
  metadata, using a small clock icon and labels like `5s ago` or `2m 3s ago`
- recovered turns can render a compact `recovered` chip in the message metadata
  row
- timed-out turns can render a compact `timeout` chip in the message metadata
  row, plus a salvaged partial draft in the timeline fallback post

### Timeout and recovery UX

When a turn stalls or times out, Piclaw now prefers salvage-first behavior in
web chat:

- preserve the last visible tool action when possible
- preserve the last draft in the draft panel when the turn stalls
- append a local fallback timeline post containing the salvaged partial draft
- attach a visible timeout marker so the fallback is distinguishable from a
  normal answer

See [runtime-flows.md](runtime-flows.md) for the runtime-level details.

## Workspace

- sidebar file browser with auto-refresh
- drag-and-drop upload progress
- client-side 256 MB upload guard before the request starts
- file-reference pills in prompts
- folder sizes in the starburst explorer
- workspace search index status with one-click reindex from the explorer header

## Editor

- CodeMirror 6 editor
- syntax highlighting for JS/TS, Python, Go, JSON, CSS, HTML, YAML, SQL,
  XML/SVG, Markdown, and Shell
- search and replace
- dirty-state tracking
- line wrapping
- lazy-loaded local bundle with no CDN dependency

## Terminal

- Ghostty-based web terminal
- real shell in the browser, not a simulation
- dock panel or standalone tab
- detachable into popout windows with live session transfer
- enabled by default on Linux and macOS
- disabled by default on Windows unless explicitly enabled

Configuration details live in [configuration.md](configuration.md).

## Viewers and panes

- **Draw.io** — self-hosted editor with SVG/PNG/XML export back to workspace
- **Office documents** — `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`
- **CSV/TSV** — dedicated table viewer
- **PDF, images, video** — inline viewers
- **Text/code attachments** — timeline preview modal for common code/config
  formats
- **Kanban boards** — `*.kanban.md` in a drag-and-drop board editor (Obsidian
  Kanban compatible)
- **Mindmaps** — `*.mindmap.yaml` in a D3/SVG visual editor
- **VNC remote display** — connect to allowlisted targets from a tab; direct
  targets are enabled by default on Linux/macOS/Windows and can be disabled
  with `PICLAW_WEB_VNC_ALLOW_DIRECT=0`

## Automation and integrations

- **`/image` and `/flux`** — workspace-backed image generation commands for
  Azure OpenAI / Foundry; `/image` supports `--transparent` when the selected
  model can generate transparent PNG output
- **`image_process`** — sharp-backed workspace image manipulation for resize,
  crop, convert, optimise, metadata inspection, text/SVG/composite operations,
  and animated GIF workflows
- **`cdp_browser`** — Chromium/Edge/Chrome automation via CDP for navigation,
  DOM clicking, JS evaluation, and screenshots
- **`mcp` via `pi-mcp-adapter`** — token-efficient MCP access through
  `.pi/mcp.json`
- **Experimental `m365` extension** — opt-in Microsoft 365 browser-auth
  automation for Teams, Graph, OneDrive, SharePoint, and calendar flows
- **`win_*` tools** — Windows-only desktop automation via Win32 FFI
