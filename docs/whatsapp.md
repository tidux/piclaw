# WhatsApp integration

The primary interface is the web UI. WhatsApp is an **opt-in secondary channel**
for chat-style access from mobile devices. It shares the same agent pool, SQLite
store, and session state as the web UI.

## Prerequisites

- A WhatsApp account you can scan a QR code or request a pairing code from
- `WHATSAPP_PHONE` set to your international number (no `+` or spaces)
- Piclaw accessible with persistent storage (the Baileys session is stored in
  `/workspace/.piclaw/data/sessions/`)

## Enabling

Set your phone number as an environment variable or in config:

```bash
PICLAW_WHATSAPP_PHONE=1234567890
```

Or in `/workspace/.piclaw/config.json`:

```json
{ "whatsappPhone": "1234567890" }
```

If `WHATSAPP_PHONE` is not set, Piclaw skips all WhatsApp connection attempts.
A no-op stub is used internally so the web UI and other channels work normally
without reconnect noise.

## Pairing

On first start with a phone number configured, Piclaw will request a pairing code
and log it. Enter the code in WhatsApp → Settings → Linked devices → Link with
phone number.

You can also scan a QR code if Piclaw logs one instead.

```bash
docker logs piclaw | grep -E 'QR|pairing'
```

## Triggering the agent

Piclaw only responds when the trigger name appears at the start of a message:

```
@PiClaw what is the weather today?
```

The trigger name matches `assistantName` in config. To set a custom name:

```json
{
  "assistant": {
    "assistantName": "PiClaw"
  }
}
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
PICLAW_ASSISTANT_NAME=MyBot
```

## Session persistence

WhatsApp state (auth keys, session identifiers) is stored via the Baileys library
in `/workspace/.piclaw/data/` as part of Piclaw's normal persistent data. Reconnects
after a container restart are usually seamless without re-scanning.

If you need to reset the WhatsApp session:

```bash
rm -rf /workspace/.piclaw/data/sessions/whatsapp*
```

Then restart Piclaw and pair again.

## Limitations

- WhatsApp is a secondary channel. Complex web-only features (file upload, Adaptive
  Cards, timeline widgets, draw.io, VNC) are not available over WhatsApp.
- Messages sent from the Piclaw WhatsApp account on other devices may be reflected
  into the agent context depending on the Baileys version.
- Rate-limiting and WhatsApp ToS apply. Do not use high-frequency automation flows
  over this channel.
- The WhatsApp channel is not compatible with suspendable or serverless hosting
  targets because Baileys requires a persistent long-lived connection.

## Disabling

Simply unset or leave `WHATSAPP_PHONE` empty. The channel is never loaded.
