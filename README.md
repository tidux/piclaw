# `piclaw` — your self-hosted AI workspace

![PiClaw](docs/icon-256.png)

PiClaw packages the [Pi Coding Agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) into a self-hosted workspace with a streaming web UI, multi-provider LLM support, persistent state, and a growing collection of built-in tools — code editor, terminal, VNC client, document viewers, kanban boards, and autonomous experiment loops.

It is built for people who want a practical, stateful agent they can run locally or in a container without stitching together half a dozen separate services.

## Why PiClaw

![Demo Animation](docs/demo.gif)

- **Streaming web UI** — real-time chat with Markdown, KaTeX, Mermaid, and Adaptive Cards
- **Persistent agent state** — SQLite-backed messages, media, tasks, token usage, encrypted keychain, and session-scoped SSH / Proxmox / Portainer profiles
- **Workspace-native workflow** — browse files, preview documents, upload attachments, drag files into the workspace explorer with progress feedback and a client-side size guard, edit code, reference files in prompts, and optionally flip core tools to a remote SSH host for the current session
- **Built-in tools** — Ghostty-based terminal, code editor, Office/PDF/CSV/image/video viewers, draw.io, kanban board and mindmap editors, VNC client, browser automation, sharp-backed image processing, bundled MCP access via `pi-mcp-adapter`, and agent-only infrastructure tools for SSH, Proxmox, and Portainer
- **Visual artifact generation** — agent-driven HTML pages, architecture diagrams, data tables, diff reviews, slide decks, and draw.io files using vendored Mermaid, ECharts, D3, and KaTeX libraries with a consistent visual-design profile (adapted from [nicobailon/visual-explainer](https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer))
- **Agent control features** — steering, queued follow-ups, threading, side prompts, autoresearch experiment loops, and scheduled tasks
- **Context conservation by default** — small always-active tool baseline, staged tool/script discovery via `list_tools` / `list_scripts` (filtered or intent-guided discovery → compact summary → on-demand detail → activate/use), lazy activation for non-default tools, and opt-in examples for higher-detail workflow help
- **Optional auth and channels** — passkeys/TOTP for the web UI, plus optional WhatsApp integration

## Quick start

```bash
mkdir -p ./home ./workspace

docker run -d \
  --init \
  --name piclaw \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e PICLAW_WEB_PORT=8080 \
  -v "$(pwd)/home:/config" \
  -v "$(pwd)/workspace:/workspace" \
  ghcr.io/rcarmo/piclaw:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and type `/login` to configure your LLM provider, including custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints when you are not using one of the built-in hosted providers.

> [!TIP]
> Keep `--init` enabled for `docker run` / `podman run` so the runtime inserts a tiny init process for signal forwarding and zombie reaping. The bundled `docker-compose.yml` now sets the equivalent `init: true` flag.

| Mount | Container path | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `/config` | Agent home (`.pi/`, `.gitconfig`, `.bashrc`) |
| Workspace | `/workspace` | Projects, notes, and piclaw state |

> [!NOTE]
> In the container image, `/home/agent/.pi` is backed by `/config/.pi`. With the stock `docker run` / `docker-compose.yml` examples above, Pi home state therefore persists on the host under `./home/.pi/agent/`.
>
> That means provider login state and model metadata should survive rebuilds/recreates when stored under files such as:
>
> - `./home/.pi/agent/auth.json`
> - `./home/.pi/agent/models.json`
>
> Mounting directly to `/home/agent` or `/home/agent/.pi/agent` can also work, but `/config` is the canonical documented persistence path for the container image.

> [!WARNING]
> Never delete `/workspace/.piclaw/store/messages.db`. It contains chat history, media, and task state.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You do **not** need to set provider API keys in piclaw environment variables. PiClaw reuses provider credentials configured in Pi Agent settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Power users can place workspace-scoped shell environment overrides in `/workspace/.env.sh`. PiClaw sources that file for the embedded terminal and on runtime startup, which is useful for things like `PATH` tweaks or persisting `gh auth login` with `GH_CONFIG_DIR=/workspace/.config/gh`. This hook is user-controlled: if its contents break PiClaw startup, shell behavior, or tool resolution, that breakage is the user's responsibility.

## Web UI

PiClaw is single-user, mobile-friendly, and streams updates over SSE.

### Chat

- Thought and draft panels during streaming
- Live steering and queued follow-ups
- Adaptive Cards with persisted submissions
- `/btw` side conversations
- File attachments, link previews, threaded turns, and syntax-highlighted previews for common text/code attachments
- Themes and tinting via `/theme` and `/tint`
- Mobile-friendly layout with webapp manifest

### Workspace

- Sidebar file browser with auto-refresh, drag-and-drop upload progress, and a client-side 256 MB upload guard before the request even starts
- File-reference pills in prompts
- Folder sizes in the starburst explorer
- Workspace search index status with one-click reindex from the explorer header

### Editor

- CodeMirror 6 with syntax highlighting for JS/TS, Python, Go, JSON, CSS, HTML, YAML, SQL, XML/SVG, Markdown, and Shell
- Search and replace, dirty-state tracking, line wrapping
- Lazy-loaded local bundle — no CDN dependency

### Terminal

- Ghostty-based web terminal — a real shell in the browser, not a simulation
- Runs as a dock panel or a standalone tab
- Detachable into popout windows with live session transfer
- Enabled by default on Linux and macOS; disable with `PICLAW_WEB_TERMINAL_ENABLED=0`
- Still disabled by default on Windows

### Viewers

- **Draw.io** — self-hosted editor with SVG/PNG/XML export back to workspace
- **Office documents** — `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`
- **CSV/TSV** — dedicated table viewer
- **PDF, images, video** — inline viewers
- **Text/code attachments** — syntax-highlighted timeline preview modal for common code/config formats
- **Kanban boards** — `*.kanban.md` in a drag-and-drop board editor (Obsidian Kanban compatible)
- **Mindmaps** — `*.mindmap.yaml` in a D3/SVG visual editor
- **VNC remote display** — connect to allowlisted targets from a tab, with direct-connect enabled by default on Linux, macOS, and Windows (experimental); disable with `PICLAW_WEB_VNC_ALLOW_DIRECT=0`

### Automation

- **`/image` and `/flux`** — workspace-backed image generation commands for Azure OpenAI / Foundry; `/image` now supports `--transparent` for transparent PNG output when the Azure OpenAI model supports it
- **`image_process`** — sharp-backed workspace image manipulation for resize/crop/convert/optimise, metadata inspection, text/SVG/composite operations, and animated GIF frame/spritesheet workflows
- **`cdp_browser`** — Chromium/Edge/Chrome automation via CDP for navigation, JS evaluation, DOM clicking, and screenshots
- **`mcp` via `pi-mcp-adapter`** — token-efficient access to external MCP servers configured through `.pi/mcp.json`
- **Experimental `m365` extension** — opt-in Microsoft 365 automation bundle for Teams, Graph, OneDrive, SharePoint, and calendar flows; enable with `PICLAW_ENABLE_M365_EXPERIMENTAL=1` (primarily validated on Windows with YOLO mode, with Edge → Chrome → Chromium browser lookup across Windows/macOS/Linux). Graph-backed consumer-account support now exists; Teams chat flows still require a work/school tenant, and the auth/browser reuse path now follows the current Teams web-app entry instead of the stale legacy route.
- **`win_*` tools** — Windows-only desktop automation via Win32 FFI for window enumeration, screenshots, element inspection, clicking, typing, and process management. No-ops on non-Windows platforms.

## Other install methods

### Install without Docker

```bash
bun add -g github:rcarmo/piclaw
```

Experimental. Linux/macOS/Windows. See [docs/install-from-repo.md](docs/install-from-repo.md).

On Windows, PiClaw remains a secondary / not-officially-supported target. Shell-like child processes now run attached there (`detached=false`) so stdout/stderr remain capturable; Unix-like hosts still use detached process groups for cleaner tree termination on abort/shutdown.

### Build from source

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).
